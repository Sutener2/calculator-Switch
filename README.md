Simple Calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator console application written in C++. It allows performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

 Features

- **Addition**: Allows adding two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Allows subtracting one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Allows multiplying two numbers.
- **Division**: Allows dividing one number by another with division by zero handling.

Prerequisites

To compile and run this application, you will need:
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
- Windows environment, as the application uses Windows-specific libraries for setting the console encoding.

 Getting Started

 Compiling the Program

You can compile the program using any C++ compiler. For example, if you are using `g++`, you can compile the program with the following command:

```bash
g++ -o calculator main.cpp
Running the Application
After compiling, you can run the application by executing:
Copy code
./calculator
Usage
Upon running the application, you will be prompted to:

1.Enter the first number.
2.Enter the second number.
3.Choose the operation you want to perform (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

Results will be displayed on the screen, and any errors (like division by zero) will be handled gracefully.
